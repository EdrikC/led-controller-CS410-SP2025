## How to Use

### Drawing on the LED Grid
- Tap or click on any pixel to color it.
- Drag across multiple pixels to draw continuously.
- Tapping a pixel again will deselect (erase) it.

### Selecting a Color
- Use the color picker wheel or the predefined color buttons.
- The currently selected color will be applied when drawing.

### Saving & Loading Presets
- Type a name into the input field and click **Save Preset**.
- Saved presets appear below with options to **Load** or **Delete**.
- Presets are stored in `localStorage` on your device.

* Note: preset implementation is not fully completed 

### Power and Brightness
- Use the **Brightness Slider** to adjust light intensity (0â€“100%).
- The **Power Button** toggles all LEDs on or off.

### Sending to ESP32

#### HTTP Mode:
- Click **"Send Full Grid (HTTP)"** to POST the entire grid to the ESP32.

#### Bluetooth Mode:
- If your ESP32 is connected via Bluetooth, each pixel interaction is sent immediately.
- The app handles Bluetooth connection through the **BluetoothScanner** component.
